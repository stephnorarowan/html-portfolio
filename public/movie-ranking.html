<h3>Song of the Sea</h3>
<p>This movie is so beautiful. The music is great and the story is lovely.</p>
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>From famed filmaker Hayao Miyazaki. A melancholy tale of loss and redemption.</p>
<h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>Two orphans try to survive WW2 in Japan as the best can. Will make anyone cry.</p>
